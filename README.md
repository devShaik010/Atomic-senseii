# Atomic Sensei

## 🧠 AI-Powered Micro Learning Platform

Atomic Sensei is an innovative educational platform that transforms learning through AI-driven microlearning delivered through device interruptions, adapting to modern attention spans and digital consumption habits.

## 🌟 Overview

Recognizing the prevalence of short-form content consumption and diminished attention spans among the new generation, Atomic Sensei "atomizes" learning into bite-sized modules delivered passively through device interruptions. By leveraging the engagement mechanisms of social media, the platform delivers personalized educational content, quizzes, and adaptive learning experiences.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- **Personalized Learning**: AI-driven system generating customized learning roadmaps
- **Atomized Content**: Complex topics broken down into digestible learning modules
- **Passive Learning Delivery**: Non-intrusive device interruptions mimicking social media
- **Short-Form Content**: Video and text formats catering to shorter attention spans
- **Adaptive Learning**: LLM integration to analyze performance and personalize content
- **Smart Assessment**: Short quizzes and spaced repetition for evaluation
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of learning progress
